## Turtle mode
As proposed in #3, the turtle mode presses the mouse left button when you put your finger on the touchpad and releases it when you move it away. That's like a touch screen device like your mobile phone, but with your laptop's touchpad. Might be useful for drawing?

## Inspector
A window showing the current mapping area on screen. This allows you to make Intuitive adjustments to the area by simply dragging and resizing the inspector window.
